Text Analyzer Problem

Objective: 

Create a Java program that prints the frequencies of all words of a poem that is located in either a .txt file or webpage, 
only counting the words in the poem itself, ignoring all HTML tags and any text outside of the poem itself, sorting in pairs with each word and their frequency, in descending order. 

Solution:

For this assignment, I decided that I wanted my text analyzer program to analyze the poem directly from the webpage url provided. For this I would use some web scraping techniques. 
First, I imported the JSoup module, which is needed to fetch and analyze webpages in Java. To isolate the poem text from the rest of the content on the webpage, I had to locate the specific HTML element 
that contained the poem. In this case it was the div.chapter.  Once this was located in the source of the webpage, JSoup could be used to analyze this specific section. To count the word frequencies, 
I used HashMap data structure. I tokenize the poem text, loop through, convert to lowercase, add to the HashMap, and then finally sort by frequency using LinkedHashMap. 
The program fetches the poem from the webpage, ignoring capitalization, non-word characters and punctuation marks, counts how many times each word appears, and then sorts the words in pairs by frequency, 
in descending order.
